# Email Fraud Detection System

## Description

Welcome to the Email Fraud Detection System project! This solution leverages Python along with NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn (imblearn), and Streamlit for deployment to detect fraudulent emails effectively.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare the email dataset for model training.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilize scikit-learn to train machine learning models for email fraud detection, leveraging algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or support vector machines.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Address imbalanced class distribution using techniques provided by imbalanced-learn to improve the model's ability to detect fraudulent emails.
- **Model Deployment:** Deploy the trained model using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input email features and receive predictions on the likelihood of fraud.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Enable real-time prediction of email fraud by integrating the deployed model with existing email systems, enhancing email security and preventing fraudulent activities.
